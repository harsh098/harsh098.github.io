I’ve worked across multiple flavors of Infrastructure Engineering - DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Consulting. To me, these are just titles; the core of the work remains solving problems and building reliable systems.

I began my career as an independent contractor during college, helping teams build MVPs. That’s where I was introduced to cloud platforms, especially AWS. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects. To avoid clutter, I’ve listed only the freelancing projects that are most relevant and impactful.

Since July 2024, I’ve been working as a Site Reliability Engineer, gaining hands-on experience across AWS, GCP, on-prem infrastructure, incident management, alerting, compliance, observability, MLOps, and more. I still feel there’s a long journey ahead and plenty left to learn - I’ve only scratched the surface.
