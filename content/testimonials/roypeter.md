I had the opportunity to work closely with Harsh Mishra for several months, and I can confidently say he is one of the most promising early career engineers I’ve come across in recent years.  

Harsh brings an impressive mix of technical depth, curiosity, and ownership that is rare to see in someone at his experience level. During our time working together, he consistently demonstrated strong capability in Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps practices, particularly across Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines. His contributions went beyond execution, Harsh showed a clear understanding of system reliability principles and often took initiative to improve the overall developer experience through automation and smarter tooling.  

What stood out to me most was his ability to think holistically about systems, understanding not just how to fix a problem, but why it occurred and how to prevent it in the future. His problem solving approach, combined with a calm and methodical attitude under pressure, made him an invaluable contributor to the team.  

Harsh has the mindset of a lifelong learner and the technical foundation to grow into a strong engineering leader. I have no doubt he will continue to make meaningful impact wherever he goes.
