summary: "This article focuses on leveraging cron-jobs in Kubernetes to pull host metrics from all nodes in Kubernetes and save them as log files. A few days ago I was asked to solve this problem as part of an interview process for an SRE position. The problem is a very nice way to brush up your skills in monitoring. So, I decided to share it with all readers."
