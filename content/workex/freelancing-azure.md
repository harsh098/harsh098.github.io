### Azure Consulting for Cloud Migration (On-Premises to Azure)

1. Migrated legacy SQL Server stored procedure architecture to 3-tier cloud architecture on Azure Enabled Vertical Partitioning in Azure SQL to maintain joins with on-premises Microsoft SQL Server during phased migration approach.
2. Implemented 3-phase migration strategy: Phase 1 (HyperV VMs → Azure VM), Phase 2 (Azure VM → VMSS with auto-scaling), Phase 3 (VMSS → Azure Container Apps for containerization).
3. Automated certificate renewal using Azure Automation Runbooks; built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps.
